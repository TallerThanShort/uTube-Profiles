## **If you are a Verified uTube Channel Holder:**

You can update your pfp on [OpenSource-uTube](https://common-codes.github.io/uTube/) by changing your corresponding pfp in `/icons`. **Make sure the new image title and format match the old one.**

_example: [XrIQDlLa33ikC1hUg-ypolNZWLk9i4JXMrh330LvU9.png](https://TallerThanShort.github.io/ut3.ggpht/icons/XrIQDlLa33ikC1hUg-ypolNZWLk9i4JXMrh330LvU9.png) must be updated with the same file name (only replacing the image)_

## All icons and banners **must be** `.png` format!
## We DO NOT TOLERATE Unsolicited Banner Updates
However, feel free to add some banners. We are always open to new banner suggestions.
